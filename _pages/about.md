This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the repository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads!

About me
======
My name is Zhipeng Yin, and I am a Ph.D. student at the Knight Foundation School of Computing and Information Sciences (KFSCIS) at Florida International University.   

My research focuses on **machine learning and interpretable artificial intelligence, with a particular emphasis on algorithmic fairness**. I explore how machine learning models can be designed and optimized to promote equitable outcomes and reduce bias, thereby advancing the development of fair and trustworthy AI systems. I am fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Wenbin Zhang](https://users.cs.fiu.edu/~wbzhang/), whose expertise lies in machine learning fairness. 

Beyond academia, I bring a strong background in software engineering, having held full-time positions in game server development and backend application development.

In my spare time, I am also a passionate photographer, keen to capture moments that tell compelling visual stories.
