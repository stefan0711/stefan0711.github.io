My name is Zhipeng Yin, and I am a Ph.D. student at the Knight Foundation School of Computing and Information Sciences (KFSCIS) at Florida International University.

My research focuses on **machine learning and interpretable artificial intelligence, with a particular emphasis on algorithmic fairness**. I explore how machine learning models can be designed and optimized to promote equitable outcomes and reduce bias, thereby advancing the development of fair and trustworthy AI systems. I am fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Wenbin Zhang](https://users.cs.fiu.edu/~wbzhang/), whose expertise lies in machine learning fairness.

Beyond academia, I bring a strong background in software engineering, having held full-time positions in game server development and backend application development. You can view my software engineering CV [here](https://cv-stefan0711s-projects.vercel.app/).

In my spare time, I am also a passionate photographer, keen to capture moments that tell compelling visual stories.
