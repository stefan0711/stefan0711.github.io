Digital forensics plays a pivotal role in modern investigative processes, utilizing specialized methods to systematically collect, analyze, and interpret digital evidence for judicial proceedings. However, traditional digital forensic techniques are primarily based on manual labor-intensive processes, which become increasingly insufficient with the rapid growth and complexity of digital data. To this end, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools capable of automating and enhancing various digital forensic tasks, significantly transforming the field. Despite the strides made, general practitioners and forensic experts often lack a comprehensive understanding of the capabilities, principles, and limitations of LLM, which limits the full potential of LLM in forensic applications. To f ill this gap, this paper aims to provide an accessible and systematic overview of how LLM has revolutionized the digital forensics approach. Specifically, it takes a look at the basic concepts of digital forensics, as well as the evolution of LLM, and emphasizes the superior capabilities of LLM. To connect theory and practice, relevant examples and real-world scenarios are discussed. We also critically analyze the current limitations of applying LLMs to digital forensics, including issues related to illusion, interpretability, bias, and ethical considerations. In addition, this paper outlines the prospects for future research, highlighting the need for effective use of LLMs for transparency, accountability, and robust standardization in the forensic process.
